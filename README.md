# EmployeeManager

Description:
EmployeeManager is a web application designed to manage employee records efficiently. The application allows users to view, update, add, and delete employee information through an intuitive web interface. Built with Spring MVC for handling web requests, Spring AOP for implementing cross-cutting concerns like logging and transaction management, and Hibernate for ORM, the application ensures robust and maintainable code. The project demonstrates key concepts of web application development, including CRUD operations, MVC architecture, and data persistence.


Technologies Used:

Spring MVC: For handling web requests and rendering views.
Spring AOP: To manage logging and other cross-cutting concerns.
Hibernate: For managing database interactions and object-relational mapping.
MySQL: As the database for storing employee data.
JSP & JSTL: For rendering the front-end views and managing server-side logic within the pages.

Role:
In this project, I was responsible for designing the architecture, implementing the backend logic, and integrating the database with the front-end. I also implemented key features such as employee data management and user interface interactions.

Outcome:
This project provided hands-on experience in building a full-stack web application, reinforcing my skills in Spring MVC, AOP, Hibernate, and general web application development principles.
